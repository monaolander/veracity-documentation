# Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

## Types of Multi-Factor Authentication offered by Veracity

### Service-specific MFA
A service can invoke MFA for all users of its service or for certain functions within its service. This is accomplished by sending the following parameter in the login request:

**NOTE! Due to a bug that has not been solved yet, the value of mfa_required must be in lower case (_true_)**

*mfa_required=true*

If only certain functions within a service shall invoke MFA, then the service can upon usage of the function redirect the user to Veracity login adding the mentioned parameter. If MFA shall only be invoked for certain users of a service (such as admin users), then after a successful standard login, the service can redirect the user back to Veracity login adding the mentioned parameter, and MFA will then be invoked.

Example of logon request invoking MFA:

<code style="overflow-wrap: break-word">
https://login.veracity.com/dnvglb2cprod.onmicrosoft.com/oauth2/v2.0/authorize?p=B2C_1A_SignInWithADFSIdp&client_id=58d531de-c4f6-4fce-b792-4a1edfe32e2d&nonce=defaultNonce&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fjwt.ms&scope=openid&response_type=id_token<strong>&mfa_required=true</strong>
</code>


### User-initiated MFA
A user can choose to always use MFA for any service they use in Veracity. This can be done on the **Security** page in the user’s profile as follows:
**Re-write**
If the user has not already defined a phone number in his profile, he will need to click on the link shown below to do so:

Once a phone number is present in the profile, the number must be verified. Clicking on the link shown below will send an SMS to the user’s registered phone number with a code that must be given as input:

![enable-mfa-step2](assets/enable-mfa-step2.png)

![enable-mfa-step3](assets/enable-mfa-step3.png)

Once the user has clicked **Verify**, he will be given the option to turn on user-initiated MFA:

![enable-mfa-step4](assets/enable-mfa-step4.png)

Upon clicking **Yes**, this result will be shown in the user’s profile and the user will be prompted for MFA on subsequent logins:

## Invoking MFA on user authentication
When MFA is invoked, it will by default only be invoked once during the lifetime of the user’s session. The session lifetime for B2C is set to 8 hours but will be terminated if user closes the browser. This means that if the user has already done MFA previously in the session, e.g. a service requested it, he will by default not be prompted again if he navigates to a new service that also requires MFA.

A service can decide to force MFA even if it has already been done earlier in the session by sending the parameters *&mfa_required=true&prompt=login* in the login request. User will then be asked both to log in and do MFA.

## Verifying that MFA has been done
In order to verify that MFA has been completed in the session and also what type of MFA has been done, you can look for the following claims:

*mfa* - has the value *true* or *false* indicting whether user authenticated with MFA or not

*mfaMethod* - can have the following values:
  - *none* - no MFA authentication was done
  - *totp* - user used TOTP as MFA method
  - *phone* - user used SMS or call as MFA method
  - *federatedIdp* - MFA was done in user's home company - see below

We still support the legacy claim *mfaType* which should have the value *phone* no matter what MFA method was used. If no MFA has been done, it has the value *none*. This claim is planned to be deprecated in the future, so you should change to use the above claims instead.

If it is a federated user, meaning the user logs in to Veracity with an account in their own company, and MFA is invoked on the federated company side, MFA will not be prompted again on Veracity side. The claim *mfaType* will then have the value *federatedIdp*.
